# botdro.twitterbot

A twitter bot made that tweets to twitter.com/botdrow.
Made using Heroku Ebooks with the help of Tom Meaggher's heroku ebooks code found at https://github.com/tommeagher/heroku_ebooks.git

Uses a basic Python port of [@harrisj's](https://twitter.com/harrisj) [iron_ebooks](https://github.com/harrisj/iron_ebooks/) Ruby script.  With a Heroku's scheduler add, it posts to a Twitter account based on the corpus of an existing Twitter Account(s) at pseudorandom intervals.
